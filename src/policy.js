// Pod-local authorization: the owner-maintained policy table every facet
// Durable Object checks fresh, per request. Jonah's 2026-08-31 decision
// (BasalMind/core session, docs/design-briefs/
// basaltribe-pod-facet-schema-reconciliation.md s7): a UCAN grant/receipt
// is a discovery hint ("like the way an MCP announces capabilities that
// are probably there"), never the access-control decision itself. This
// module IS that decision -- default-deny, explicit-deny-wins, evaluated
// against a live table, never a presented token.
//
// DO-agnostic by design: takes a `sql` function (the same shape PodRoot's
// own `this.sql(...)` already exposes) rather than importing a specific
// Durable Object class, so any future facet-type DO can adopt this exact
// module unchanged -- the shared mechanism the facet-schema doc describes,
// not a PodRoot-specific feature.
//
// Owner-access invariant: the owner is never subject to this table at
// all -- rooted in identity (the DID recorded as pod_meta.owner_did at
// setup time), not in a policy row, specifically so a wiped or empty
// policy table can default-deny every OTHER principal while the owner
// still reaches their own pod. See evaluatePolicy()'s own doc comment.
//
// Caller-identity gap, stated plainly rather than assumed: this module
// answers "does the policy table permit principalDid to do this," given a
// principalDid the CALLER already asserts. It does not itself verify that
// the caller genuinely controls that DID -- that's a request-signature
// verification step (checking a signed request against a key the
// caller's did:webvh log currently authorizes, mirroring
// BasalTribe/basaltribe/pod_did_verifier.py's server-side verification)
// that does not exist yet in this template. Every caller of
// evaluatePolicy() MUST authenticate principalDid before calling this,
// or the whole mechanism is decorative. Named here, not built yet, same
// "ship what's real, name the rest" discipline used on the Python side
// this session.
