# PODS-template

Sovereign pod launch template (proof of concept).

This is BasalMind's published protocol for standing up a sovereign data pod: a Cloudflare
Durable Object, deployed to **your own** Cloudflare account, using **your own** credentials, on
**your own** device or a GitHub Action running under **your own** repo. BasalMind never touches
your Cloudflare account, never holds a credential to it, and has no technical capability to.

## What this proves, and what it doesn't yet

**Current status: proof of concept.** This repo demonstrates the launch *mechanics* -- get your
own copy, add your own credentials as repo secrets, run one workflow, and a real Durable Object
exists in your own Cloudflare account, all without BasalMind ever seeing your token. It
deliberately does **not** yet include:

- A binding certificate linking this pod to a verified BasalMind identity.
- Any real facet (personal outcomes, relationships, offerings, etc.) -- only the pod-root
  routing facet, which holds no personal data.
- Signed releases or a transparency log for this repo's own code. Until those exist, running
  this workflow means trusting that this specific commit of this specific repo does what it
  says -- read `src/index.js` yourself before running it against a real account, the same way
  you should for any script that runs with your credentials loaded. This is a named, accepted
  gap for a proof-of-concept pass, not an oversight.

None of the above blocks proving the mechanics work. All of it is real, separate, sequenced work
before this becomes the production pod-launch flow.

## How it works

1. Click **[Use this template](../../generate)** (or the green "Use this template" button on
   this repo's page) and create a new repository in your own GitHub account. This gives you a
   full, independent copy -- no ongoing link back to BasalMind's repo, which is the right
   relationship for launching your own pod rather than contributing to this one.
   - **Alternative for anyone who'd rather track this template's own updates**: forking works
     too, and keeps the upstream link so you can pull in changes later. Either path leads to the
     same next step.
2. In your new repo's settings, add two repository secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` -- an API token from your own Cloudflare account
     (`dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens`), scoped at minimum to Workers Scripts: Edit.
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` -- your own Cloudflare account ID (visible on the Cloudflare
     dashboard's right sidebar for any zone, or via `wrangler whoami`).
3. Go to your repo's **Actions** tab, select **Setup Pod**, and click **Run workflow**.
   (If this is a fork rather than a template-generated copy, GitHub disables Actions on forks by
   default -- there's a one-time "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" banner to
   click first.)
4. The workflow deploys `src/index.js` to a Worker in your own account. Its `*.workers.dev` URL
   is printed in the deploy step's output.
5. Visit `<your-worker-url>/setup`, then `<your-worker-url>/status` to confirm a real pod-root
   Durable Object is running and answering.

At no point does this repo, this workflow, or BasalMind's own infrastructure receive your
Cloudflare token -- it lives only in your own repo's GitHub Actions secrets, which GitHub
encrypts and exposes only inside your own workflow runs.

This manual, direct-on-GitHub path is meant to stay available even after pod launch is linked
from inside BasalTribe's own onboarding UI -- a standing option for anyone who'd rather do it
themselves than go through the app.

## What's inside

- `wrangler.jsonc` -- Worker + Durable Object configuration, SQLite storage backend.
- `src/index.js` -- the pod-root facet: a `PodRoot` Durable Object holding pod identity
  (`pod_meta`) and a directory of registered facets (`facet_directory`). Holds no facet
  contents, ever -- see `docs/design-briefs/basaltribe-pod-facet-schema.md` (BasalMind's
  `core` repo) s0.2 for why pod-root is scoped this narrowly.
- `.github/workflows/setup-pod.yml` -- the deploy action described above.
- `test/pod-root.test.js` -- runs against the real Cloudflare Workers runtime locally
  (`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`), not a mock. `npm install && npm test` to run it yourself
  before trusting any of the above.
